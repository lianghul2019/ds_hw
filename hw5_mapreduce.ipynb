    "## MapReduce Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is conceptually very simple. Read the lecture notes, and optionally the [Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to understand it. Here's a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Map function is called on each element of a list of inputs, producing a list of dictionaries. Each input (in any format) is converted to a dictionary from a key to some intermediate value. Once you figure out what a good intermediate value for the problem you're trying to solve, the Map and Reduce functions are usually obvious. \n",
    "2. The Partition function (sometimes called Shuffle or Collate) converts the produced list-of-dictionaries into a dictionary-of-lists. Each key/value pair in the output dictionay is sometimes called a Partition.\n",
    "3. The Reduce function converts each value in the dictionary-of-lists into a single value, making it a dictionary-of-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have to complete this implementation of MapReduce by filling in the partition function. We have included type hints, but you don't need them to complete this; you can optionally read more about them [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)."

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "nodes = [...] # A collection of nodes\n",

    "        \n",
    "        # If this is a dead-end node:\n",
    "        if num_outgoing == 0:\n",
    "            for destination in nodes:\n",
    "                update[destination] += pr[source]/len(nodes)\n",

    "    for node in nodes:\n",
    "        pr[node] = update[node]*d + (1-d)/n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should not actually use this algorithm for calculating this; that would be too slow. Instead, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Observe that your function is given `num_outgoing`, the number of outgoing edges from each node, and `incoming`, the source nodes that have edges ending in your nodes.\n",
    "2. Rewrite the above pseudocode to calculate the new pagerank for a single node using `incoming` rather than as shown in the pseudocode above.\n",
    "3. Implement this using PageRank (Additional hint: the reduce function is very simple! All the heavy lifting is done in the map function.)\n",
    "4. Verify that your algorithm is numerically correct on the small, and then the large test case provided.\n",
    "5. Time your algorithm and make sure it completes all tests in under 120s. The Optimization section has hints on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a good idea to come to TA hours with pseudocode or ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges is making your code run quickly. We've already arranged the code so you should be able to meet the time requirement. Also, we will be evaluating your code on only a few iterations instead of 100 iterations. Ensure that your function takes under 120s on a modern laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some hints on optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. While you have sufficient information to solve the problem with the arguments to `pr_map`, you can significantly improve the speed by precomputing a little information. Feel free to change `gen` in `pagerank` to pass precomputed information to the workers.\n",
    "2. It may not be at all necessary to improve this, though, so submit your code once before trying to optimize it. \n",
    "3. We use the generator `gen` to bundle arguments to feed them to `mapreduce`. We are grouping the incoming nodes into chunks of `2**11 = 2048` nodes; we experimentally found that this balances the overhead of transferring data to the worker processes against the amount of work per chunk. You may change this. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that this method is much slower than that in Homework 2. It took about 6s to run all tests using the original sparse matrix implementation on a single core; this will take about a 60s to do the same on a 6-core machine. The main reasons for the slow-down are the setup time (in spawning new processes for the multiprocessing pool), the communication overhead (marshaling, sending data to each process, and unmarshaling it), and the use of the Python dictionary instead of heavily-optimized Numpy sparse matrix math.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "You should complete `pr_map` and `pr_reduce` (and optionally modify `pagerank`) to calculate the pagerank of nodes in the input graph, following the type signatures. 100 iterations of this should complete in under 120s. You may choose any intermediate representation (though a very simple one is sufficient to solve the problem)."
