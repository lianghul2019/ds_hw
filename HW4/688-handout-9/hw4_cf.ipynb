    "In collaborative filtering, we take the matrix of user ratings and attempt to factorize it into user-related features and movie-related features. By viewing ratings as the product of both user and movie properties, we can predict user ratings on movies they have not yet watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more formal terms, given some partially filled ratings matrix $X\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$, we want to find feature matrices $U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times k}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$ such that $UV^T = X$. Each row of $U$ is a feature-vector corresponding to a user, and each row of $V$ is a feature-vector corresponding to a movie. $u_i^Tv_j$ is the predicted rating of user $i$ on movie $j$. This is our hypothesis function for collaborative filtering:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ is usually quite sparse, so we can indicate the absence of a rating with the value 0. Let $S$ be the set of $(i,j)$ such that $X_{i,j} \\neq 0$, so $S$ is the set of all pairs for which we have a rating. When factorizing $X$ into $U$ and $V$, we wish to minimize the squared loss between our hypothesis for $(i,j) \\in S$ and the actual value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ell\\left(h_\\theta(i,j),X_{i,j}\\right) = \\left(h_\\theta(i,j) - X_{i,j}\\right)^2\\qquad\\forall (i,j) \\in S$$\n",
